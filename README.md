# dice
This project is part of the course "The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart" on Udemy. It implements a simple dice rolling app using Flutter, 
a UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

In this app, users can roll two dice by tapping on the screen, and the numbers displayed on the dice faces will change randomly. 
It demonstrates basic Flutter concepts such as stateful widgets, handling user input, and updating the UI dynamically.

This project serves as a practical exercise to reinforce the lessons learned in the Flutter development course on Udemy.
